  "description": "Localizely is a translation management system for agile teams that streamlines software localization. \n\nWe believe translation management for apps should be easy, so the team can focus on things that bring business value.\n\nDevelopers can easily integrate translations into the apps build process, and managers can easily collaborate with translators.\n\nWe built Localizely from our experience by working on software projects with 2 to 100 languages.",

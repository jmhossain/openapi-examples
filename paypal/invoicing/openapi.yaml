    Use the Invoicing API to create, send, and manage invoices. You can also use
    the API or webhooks to track invoice payments. When you send an invoice to a
    customer, the invoice moves from draft to payable state. PayPal then emails
    the customer a link to the invoice on the PayPal website. Customers with a
    PayPal account can log in and pay the invoice with PayPal. Alternatively,
    customers can pay as a guest with a debit card or credit card. For more
    information, see the <a href="/docs/invoicing/">Invoicing Overview</a> and
    the <a href="/docs/invoicing/basic-integration/">Invoicing Integration
    Guide</a>.

      Use the `/invoices` resource to create, update, and send invoices and
      invoice reminders. To manage invoices, you can also list invoices, show
      details for invoices, delete draft invoices, and cancel sent invoices. You
      can also record payments for invoices to mark them as fully or partially
      paid, or record refunds for invoices to mark them as fully or partially
      refunded. You can create QR codes for invoices that can be scanned,
      viewed, and paid by a mobile phone.

      Use the `/templates` resource to create, list, show details for, update,
      and delete invoice templates. Use the `/templates` resource when you
      create a third-party invoicing application. For instance, a business can
      create a template with predefined invoice data. Later, the business can
      select the template to populate the invoice
      data.<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> To upload a logo to display on an
      invoice, you can use the <strong>Template Settings</strong> dashboard to
      <a href="https://www.paypal.com/invoice/settings/templates">create a
      template</a>. When you create an invoice, you can use the URI for that
      logo.</blockquote>

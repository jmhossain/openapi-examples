      Enables you to perform a Work Contact Change task. Using these REST APIs,
      you can get and update work contact information such as address, e-mail
      address, phone number, web address, and instant messenger.


      To start and submit a work contact change request for a specific person: 


      1. Initiate a work contact change event by calling a POST request for a
      role that can use this business process. Example: the POST
      staffing/workers/{ID}/workContactInformationChanges operation that returns
      a new work contact change ID. 


      2. Update data for the work contact change request by calling operations
      on the available person/workContactInformationChanges/{id}/{subresource}
      endpoints. These allow you to add, update, or remove work contact
      information.  The correct Usage Type to use when doing so is Work,
      "1f27f250dfaa4724ab1e1617174281e4"


      3. Submit the work contact change request by calling the POST
      person/workContactInformationChanges/{ID}/submit endpoint. The updated
      data in the preceding work contact change requests don't persist until you
      call POST person/workContactInformationChanges/{ID}/submit.

      Enables you to perform a Home Contact Change task. Using these REST APIs,
      you can get and update home contact information such as address, e-mail
      address, phone number, web address, and instant messenger.


      To start and submit a home contact change request for a specific person: 


      1. Initiate a home contact change event by calling a POST request for a
      role that can use this business process. Example: the POST
      staffing/workers/{ID}/homeContactInformationChanges operation that returns
      a new home contact change ID. 


      2. Update data for the home contact change request by calling operations
      on the available person/homeContactInformationChanges/{id}/{subresource}
      endpoints. These allow you to add, update, or remove home contact
      information.  The correct Usage Type to use when doing so is Home,
      "836cf00ef5974ac08b786079866c946f"


      3. Submit the home contact change request by calling the POST
      person/homeContactInformationChanges/{ID}/submit endpoint. The updated
      data in the preceding home contact change requests don't persist until you
      call POST person/homeContactInformationChanges/{ID}/submit.

        Validates the specified completePhoneNumber in the request body.

        The completePhoneNumber field is required in the request body.


        If the specified completePhoneNumber is valid, this method returns the
        201 response status. If the specified completePhoneNumber is invalid,
        this method returns the 400 response status with a validation error
        message. 


        This method assumes the Allowed Phone Validations for the country of the
        phone is enabled on the Tenant Setup - Global configuration.

        If the tenant configuration has disabled the Allowed Phone Validations
        for the associated country, the validation returns as valid.

        Submits the specified work contact information change ID. 


        To submit the Work Contact Change event and initiate the Work Contact
        Change business process, specify an empty request body: {}.

        To save for later, specify this request body:

        {
            "businessProcessParameters": {
                "action":{
                    "id": "d9e41a8c446c11de98360015c5e6daf6"
                }
            }
        }


        The action id value is the Workday ID of the Save for Later action. If
        you submit this endpoint with the Save for Later action, you can no
        longer edit nor resubmit the Work Contact Change event using the REST
        APIs. The user with correct permissions can edit and submit the saved
        Work Contact Change event in the Workday UI.

        To submit the Home Contact Change event and initiate the Home Contact
        Change business process, specify an empty request body: {}.

        To save for later, specify this request body:

        {

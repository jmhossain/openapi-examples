        __NOTE__: If a non-archived inventory item is found with the same

        it will be marked as "archived" and a new inventory item will be
        created. As a result, subsequent GET

        requests will no longer return the old inventory item. As mentioned in
        the GET method description, you can query

        for archived items by including the "include_archived" query parameter.

      description: >
        You must authenticate your requests by including your API key in each
        request header as described below.


        Requests should include a header named `Authorization`, with the value
        `App {MY_API_KEY}`. Note the single space in the header value.


        Example: `Authorization: App MY_API_KEY`


        [Learn more about generating your
        key](https://developer.leaflink.com/brands/api/getting-started/)


        **Legacy API keys:** If you are not using an Application API key, your
        authorization header should include the string `Token` and access will
        be scoped to all companies under which the user exists as a
        companystaff.


        Example: `Authorization: Token MY_API_KEY`

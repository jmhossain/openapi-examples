        Add a company level job. If a client has their job numbering structured
        in 2-3 separate 'segments', you may need to first do a GET on the

        which you will need to have before you POST.

      summary: In Progress Workers
      operationId: Company_addInProgressWorkers
      description: >-
        Add one or more workers to a specific company that your application has
        been granted access to. These workers will be added with an IN_PROGRESS
        status assigned to them.  In_Progress workers will pre-populated within
        Paychex Flex and will require someone to complete them to be fully
        available with the Flex platform.  Paychex Flex UI will hold a majority
        of validation, rules, and enforced required fields based on the clients
        configuration.  Required fields are givenName, familyName, & workerType
        (when adding multiple workers at a time you will need to also include a
        "workerCorrelationId" data element on each worker, that will be used as
        an identifier in our responses). Optionally you can include a workers
        communications object within the worker.  Once generated the IN_PROGRESS
        worker can have their communications, Compensation and Federal Taxes
        POSTed and PATCHed using the generated workerId.

      description: >-
        Add one or more contacts to a worker. A contact may represent a person
        or entity (organization) but not both. A contact must have at least one
        communication (telecom, postal, or email). Person contacts can have
        multiple communications for each communication type (telecom, postal, or
        email) to support BUSINESS and PERSONAL. Exactly one contact must be
        marked as primary for each contact type. If one or more contacts are
        posted for the same contact type, and there are currently no contacts of
        that type for the worker, the first contact in the list will be made
        primary unless another in the list is expressly marked as primary. When
        a new contact is made primary the previous primary contact will be
        marked as not primary. Use the GET /companies/{companyId}/contacttypes
        endpoint to get a full list of available contact types and relationship
        types (used for person contacts).

      description: >-
        Update a worker contact. A contact may represent a person or entity
        (organization) but not both. A contact must have at least one
        communication (telecom, postal, or email). Person contacts can have
        multiple communications for each communication type (telecom, postal, or
        email) to support BUSINESS and PERSONAL. Exactly one contact must be
        marked as primary for each contact type. When a new contact is made
        primary the previous primary contact will be marked as not primary. A
        postal contact can be switched from a street address to a PO box and
        vice versa. This is done by setting either streetLineOne or
        postOfficeBox (a postal communication may not have both). Use the GET
        /companies/{companyId}/contacttypes endpoint to get a full list of
        available contact types and relationship types (used for person
        contacts).

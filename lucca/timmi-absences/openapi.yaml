        FirstName | First name

        Account number or name (one column per account) | Value to import for
        the account defined in the header.



        *Remark:

        A template file can be downloaded from the import page (Credit / Debit>
        A group of collaborators> File import).*


        In the event of a malformed (or unrecognized) file, no data will be
        imported; the problems detected will be specified in the `globalErrors`
        field.


        If successful, the number of imported lines is indicated by the
        “successLinesCount” field; the lines in error are detailed in the
        `lineErrors` field.



        *Remarks:

        Any import made by the API is of course available in the import history.

        A simulation returns the same level of information, but does not trigger
        an import*

        Absences from work, wether they are planned or not, are described in
        Lucca using three concepts : **LeaveRequests**, **LeavePeriods** and
        **Leaves**.


        A **LeaveRequest** represent the request made by employees when planning
        time off. This resource is used for workflow purposes.


        A **LeavePeriod** is the continuous period of absence requested by the
        employee or entered by HR. It is linked to a **LeaveRequest** if
        workflow applies.


        A **Leave** is the subdivision of a **LeavePeriod**. There is one
        **Leave** per half-day of the **LeavePeriod**. Each **Leave** is linked
        to a **LeaveAccount**, which represent the type of leave (PTO, Sick
        Leave, Congés payés, RTT, etc).


        ![Timmi Absences -
        UML](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjEwNjgxNg/images/6yaK9GNTQ08)


        There can only be one **Leave** per half-day. This prevents duplicates.

        For **Leaves** expressed in hours (as opposed to **Leaves** in days),
        the duration of the **Leave** is stored in the value field of the
        **Leave**. The previous constraint implies that there can only be one
        type of **Leave** per half-day. This issue is solved in the next version
        of the API.

    LeaveRequest:
      title: The LeaveRequest resource
      description: >-
        Absences from work, wether they are planned or not, are described in
        Lucca using three concepts : **LeaveRequests**, **LeavePeriods** and
        **Leaves**.


        A **LeaveRequest** represent the request made by employees when planning
        time off. This resource is used for workflow purposes.


        A **LeavePeriod** is the continuous period of absence requested by the
        employee or entered by HR. It is linked to a **LeaveRequest** if
        workflow applies.


        A **Leave** is the subdivision of a **LeavePeriod**. There is one
        **Leave** per half-day of the **LeavePeriod**. Each **Leave** is linked
        to a **LeaveAccount**, which represent the type of leave (PTO, Sick
        Leave, Congés payés, RTT, etc).

        **LeaveRequests** status are by default in the `pending_approval` state.
        **LeaveRequests** status can be `approved`, `denied`, `cancelled` or in
        the `cancellation_pending` state.
